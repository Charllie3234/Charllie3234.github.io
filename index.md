### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1, part 1 was one of my favorite labs because I really wanted to know how code, write, and display the two word "Hello World" on a computer. Using std::cout was so much fun and exciting because of the various things you can do with it. At the end it was very satisfying to see the words "Hello World" on my screen.

* Lab 4

    Another lab I enjoyed was lab 4 part 1. Converting different measures of liquid was very fun to do. My favorite subject is Math and this lab involved a lot of it.

* Lab 9

    I liked lab 9 because we creating a word guessing game. I play games everyday it was fun finally making my own. Overall this was probably my favorite lab we did.
